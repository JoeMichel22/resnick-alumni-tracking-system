This repository contains the documentation, design mockups, and user manual for the Resnick Alumni Tracking System — a full-stack web application developed for the **Resnick Academic Support Center for Student-Athletes** at **Temple University**.

## 🧩 Project Overview
The Resnick Alumni Tracking System was designed to replace a manual Excel-based tracking process with a centralized digital system for managing alumni data. It enables staff to:
- Create and update alumni profiles
- Track education, employment, and engagement history
- Import/export data from spreadsheets
- Assign user roles and manage access permissions

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Figma
- **Backend:** ASP.NET, C#
- **Database:** SQL
- **Collaboration Tools:** Git, Microsoft Teams, Axure, Google Surveys

## 👥 Team Role
Collaborated with a 5-person development team as part of Temple University’s Capstone course.  
My primary contributions included:
- Designing the user interface using **Figma** and **Axure**
- Implementing data filtering and search functionality with **ASP.NET**
- Conducting user testing and gathering feedback
- Creating sections of the user manual and documenting system workflows

## 📚 Deliverables

## 💡 Outcome
This project improved alumni data management efficiency and provided the Resnick Center with a scalable, user-friendly system for long-term use.  
It also enhanced my skills in teamwork, project documentation, UI design, and database management.
