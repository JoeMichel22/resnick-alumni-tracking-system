## üë• Team Role
Collaborated with a 5-person development team as part of Temple University‚Äôs Capstone course.  
My primary contributions included:
- Designing the user interface using **Figma** and **Axure**
- Implementing data filtering and search functionality with **ASP.NET**
- Conducting user testing and gathering feedback
- Creating sections of the user manual and documenting system workflows
